# Personal Portfolio Project

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my work and projects. It is built with a focus on organization and professional structure.

## Site Content

The website is divided into the following main sections:
- A homepage (index) featuring the main introduction and projects.
- Specific project pages to show detailed work.
- A contact page with a functional form.
- Navigation menus to move easily between all sections.

## Technical Structure

The project is built using three main technologies:

1. HTML: I used semantic tags like header, main, section, aside, and footer to keep the information well-structured.
2. CSS: I used Flexbox for the layout and specific stylesheets for each page to keep the design organized.
3. JavaScript: I added separate scripts for a typewriter effect, an image zoom system, and form validation.
